- How have you been?  

- We haven't talking a while.  

- Did you come up with a conclusion?  
  - We just have a rough idea for now.  

- Any plans for tonight?  
  - I have a party at my friend's house in the evening.  

- Are you having any drinks at the party?  
  - I'm not having drinks today.

오늘 파티에서 술 마실거에요?  
오늘은 술 안 마실거에요
