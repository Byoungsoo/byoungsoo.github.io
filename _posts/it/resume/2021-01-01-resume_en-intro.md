**Introduce**

 Hello, I'm Byoungsoo Ko, who has been working as a Software Engineer & Solution Architect for more than 7 years at LG CNS, Kakao Enterprise.  

&nbsp;  I mainly carried out projects in the AWS cloud environment, and main roles in recent projects were to build environments related to MSA Outer, such as Kubernetes environment construction, CI/CD environment construction, pipeline construction, and container logging environment construction, and configure WEB/WAS middleware, etc.  

&nbsp;  In addition to this, I understand the overall architecture of network setup and configuration in cloud environments, servers, and various AWS services. Based on this, I designed AWS architecture for my customer and help trouble shooting for problems that occur during application migration.  

&nbsp; What I felt while using AWS cloud were happiness, worthwhile, amazing. I could provide much better architecture satisfied customer's needs to customer. I was a user of AWS, but I really want to join AWS and want to be more involved deeply.
