**채용과정**
솔루션즈 아키텍트는 고객들의 클라우드 도입/전환 과정에서 필요한 기술적인 조언과 지원을 제공하는 역할을 수행합니다.  
AWS나 클라우드 사용경험이 없어도 다양한 기술분야에 대한 깊이있는 hands-on 경험과 새로운 기술에 대한 호기심이 있는 분들에게 적합한 포지션입니다.  
역할이 낮선 분들을 위해 팀에서는 Architect로 원활하게 정착할 수 있도록 장기적인 온보딩/transformation 프로그램을 운영하고 있습니다.  

인터뷰는 1차 기술 인터뷰 à 2차 기술 인터뷰(과제 기반) à 최종 인터뷰의 단계로, 모두 원격으로 진행합니다.  
채용 과정에서 중요하게 생각하는 부분과 그렇지 않은 부분을 나누어서 설명 드리면 다음과 같습니다.  

<중요한 부분>  

1. 기술 전문성: 특정 영역에 대한 강점을 포함한 전반적 IT 전문성  
2. 호기심: 새로운 기술 습득에 대한 관심과 열정(특정 기술분야에 매몰되지 않고 새로운 기술에 대한 꾸준한 학습을 하시는 분)  
3. 커뮤니케이션: 구조화된 메시지 전달을 할 수 있는 커뮤니케이션 스킬  

<중요하지 않은 부분>  

1. AWS/Cloud 경험: 입사하고 배워도 됩니다만, 어느정도의 관심이 있으면 도움이 됩니다.  
2. 영어: 읽고 쓸 줄 알면 말하는 건 장기적으로 천천히 준비해 가도 됩니다.  

첫 인터뷰는 기술영역 전반(dev, DB, storage, network, security, virtualization, etc)에 대한 한국어 구술 인터뷰 형태로 진행되며  
Customer facing/influencing role 인 만큼 communication skill도 중요하게 생각합니다.  

AWS 나 클라우드 관련 보다는 다양한 IT 분야에 대한 기본개념에 대한 이해를 묻는 질문들이 많습니다.  
(ex. 3 tier 웹 어플리케이션의 정의와 구성방식? 컨테이너? distributed and scalable systems 구성 시 고려할 요소? CI/CD? micro services design 의 장단점? Load Balancer란?
 TCP와 UDP의 차이는? RDBMS와 NoSQL의 차이는? 웹방화벽이 일반 방화벽과 어떻게 다른지? RAID는? Hadoop등등)  

얼마나 fundamental한 지식이 잘 갖추어져 있는지, 어느 부분이 강하고 약한지 포괄적으로 점검하기 위한 단계이므로 모든 질문에 전부 답하기는 어렵습니다.  
아시는 범위내에서 차분하게 정리해서 답변해 주시면 됩니다.

**LP**

1. Customer Obsession
   Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

   고객 집착의 경험 신뢰를 쌓기 위해 했던 것들.

2. Ownership
   Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."

   주인의식을 가진 경험 혹은 장기적인 관점의 가치를 위하여 단기적인 관점의 결과를 포기한 것

3. Invent and Simplify
   Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

   혁신과 단순함, 

4. Are Right, A Lot
   Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

   리더는 대부분 옳은 판단을 해야한다. 리더는 강한 판단력과 좋은 통찰력을 가지고 있다. 다양한 사고방식을 추구하고, 자신의 생각을 반증하는 데 거리낌이 없어야 한다.

5. Learn and Be Curious
   Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

6. Hire and Develop the Best
   Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

7. Insist on the Highest Standards
   Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

8. Think Big
   Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

9. Bias for Action
   Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 

10. Frugality
    Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

11. Earn Trust
    Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

12. Dive Deep
    Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
    Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

14. Deliver Results
    Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

15. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer
    Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility
    We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.
